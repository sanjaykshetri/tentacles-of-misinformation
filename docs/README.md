## Figures

- Distributions of behavioral features
- Confusion matrices and ROC curves
- Feature importance plots
- Model performance comparisons
- Architecture diagrams

## How to Reference

All figures should be referenced in the Quarto book (`book/chapters/`).

## Updating Documentation

As the project evolves:
1. Update relevant chapter in `book/chapters/`
2. Save new figures in `docs/figures/`
3. Update architecture diagrams if major changes occur
4. Rebuild the book with Quarto

## Tools

- Matplotlib / Seaborn for publication-quality plots
- Graphviz / Draw.io for architecture diagrams
- Quarto for document generation

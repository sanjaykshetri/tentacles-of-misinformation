# Baseline NLP Models

## Objective

Before deploying complex deep learning models, it is critical to establish strong baselines using classical NLP techniques. This chapter documents:

- **Vectorization**: TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency)
- **Models**: Logistic Regression and Linear SVM with class weighting
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics to assess performance and identify failure modes
- **Insights**: What works, what doesn't, and why deeper features are needed

---

## Why Baselines Matter

Baselines are not optional—they are essential:

1. **Sanity Check**: Confirms the problem is learnable
2. **Benchmark**: Sets a bar for deep learning models to beat
3. **Interpretability**: Simpler models are easier to debug and understand
4. **Efficiency**: Baselines often run in seconds; transformers take hours
5. **Storytelling**: Shows you understand the full ML pipeline

---

## Methodology

### Data Preparation

- **Dataset**: 21,724 articles from FakeNewsNet
- **Train/Val Split**: 80/20 with **stratification** to preserve class distribution
- **Text Feature**: Article titles (6,422 unique terms after vectorization)

### TF-IDF Vectorization

```
TfidfVectorizer(
    stop_words="english",
    max_features=10000,
    ngram_range=(1, 2),           # unigrams + bigrams
    min_df=5,                      # appear in at least 5 docs
    max_df=0.8,                    # appear in at most 80% of docs
    sublinear_tf=True              # scale term frequencies logarithmically
)
```

This represents each article as a sparse 6,422-dimensional vector.

### Class Balancing

Since the dataset is **3.2:1 imbalanced** (76% real, 24% fake):

- **Logistic Regression**: `class_weight="balanced"`
- **Linear SVM**: `class_weight="balanced"`

This ensures the model penalizes misclassifying the minority class (fake articles) appropriately.

## Results Summary

| Metric | Logistic Regression | Linear SVM |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Accuracy** | 81.2% | 79.3% |
| **F1 Score** | 0.644 | 0.612 |
| **ROC-AUC** | **0.859** | 0.841 |
| **Precision (Fake)** | 59% | 56% |
| **Recall (Fake)** | 71% | 69% |

**Winner**: Logistic Regression (highest ROC-AUC)

## Confusion Matrices

### Logistic Regression

|  | Predicted Real | Predicted Fake |
|---|---|---|
| **Actual Real** | 2,788 | 517 |
| **Actual Fake** | 300 | 740 |

- **True Negatives**: 2,788 (84% of real articles correct)
- **False Positives**: 517 (16% of real articles misclassified as fake)
- **False Negatives**: 300 (29% of fake articles misclassified as real)
- **True Positives**: 740 (71% of fake articles correctly identified)

### Linear SVM

|  | Predicted Real | Predicted Fake |
|---|---|---|
| **Actual Real** | 2,733 | 572 |
| **Actual Fake** | 325 | 715 |

SVM is more conservative, producing slightly more false negatives.

## Error Analysis

### False Positives (Real → Fake)

Real articles that the model mistakenly classified as fake: **517 samples**

**Examples**:
- "Angelina Jolie Travels to Jordan with Daughters Shiloh and Zahara to Meet with S..."
- "Lady Gaga's Style Is Unremarkable in 'A Star Is Born'"
- "Britney Spears Shares Kissable Moments With Boyfriend Sam Asghari in Romantic Vi..."

**Pattern**: Entertainment/celebrity content from **Politifact** with sensational phrasing.

**Root Cause**: While these are *technically real* (from fact-checkers), they use emotional language ("Kissable," "Unremarkable") that overlaps with fake article linguistic patterns from GossipCop.

### False Negatives (Fake → Real)

Fake articles that the model mistakenly classified as real: **300 samples**

**Examples**:
- "JAY-Z – Lucifer"
- "Ranking The Real Housewives by Net Worth"
- "Teen Choice Awards Nominations 2017 — Full, Final List Of Nominees"

**Pattern**: Listicles, music/award show titles, and neutral phrasing articles from **GossipCop**.

**Root Cause**: GossipCop fake articles often mimic legitimate entertainment reporting. Simple title-based features cannot distinguish between real and fake reporting in the same domain (entertainment).

---

## Key Insights

### ✅ What Works

1. **Title-based TF-IDF captures domain differences**
   - Politifact articles use political vocabulary (Trump, Congress, policy)
   - GossipCop articles use entertainment vocabulary (celebrity names, awards)

2. **Class weighting effectively handles imbalance**
   - Logistic Regression achieves 71% recall on minority class (fake)
   - Better than naive baseline (would predict majority class only)

3. **ROC-AUC ~0.86 is reasonable for a baseline**
   - Not trivial (random = 0.5)
   - But not production-ready (need 0.90+)

### ⚠️ What Doesn't Work

1. **Title length alone is insufficient**
   - Real and fake articles have similar title lengths (~11 words)
   - Suggests content structure ≠ lexical items

2. **Bag-of-words misses semantic nuance**
   - Can't distinguish between sensational *real* and *fake*
   - E.g., both "Shocking News About Politicians" (real) and "Shocking News About Celebrities" (fake) use similar words

3. **Domain generalization is weak**
   - 517 false positives: real entertainment articles flagged as fake
   - Model learns domain-specific patterns, not deception signals

### 💡 Implications for Sprint 3

To improve beyond this baseline, we need:

1. **Linguistic Features**
   - Emotion scores (are fake articles more sensational?)
   - Subjectivity (are fake articles more opinionated?)
   - Readability (are fake articles simpler/more complex?)
   - Lexical diversity (vocabulary richness)

2. **Behavioral Features**
   - Certainty/hedging words ("definitely" vs "possibly")
   - Named entity types (political vs celebrity figures)
   - Temporal markers (urgency signals)

3. **Domain-Aware Modeling**
   - Separate models for Politifact and GossipCop
   - Or domain adaptation techniques

---

## Conclusion

This baseline establishes a **functional, interpretable model** that correctly classifies 81% of articles and achieves 0.859 ROC-AUC. However, the systematic failure modes—especially difficulty distinguishing sensational real articles from fake ones—reveal that **linguistic style alone is insufficient for robust misinformation detection**.

The next phase (Sprint 3) will add richer features grounded in behavioral science and cognitive psychology, leveraging the insights from this error analysis.

# 🐙 The Tentacles of Misinformation

An end-to-end research and machine learning platform integrating **behavioral science, NLP, and big data** to study
who falls for misinformation, why, and how susceptibility can be predicted and mitigated.

This project expands on an IRB-approved Master's thesis on cognitive vulnerability to misinformation and extends it
with large-scale NLP models and fusion architectures.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Analyze behavioral predictors of misinformation susceptibility
- Train NLP models to detect misinformation narratives at scale
- Fuse human cognitive features with text features for risk prediction
- Build interactive dashboards for decision support
- Publish a research monograph using Quarto

## 🧩 Project Components

### 🧠 Behavioral Analysis
Survey-based cognitive and mindset features, statistical modeling, and vulnerability profiling.

### 🤖 NLP Pipelines
Text preprocessing, embeddings (SBERT/transformers), and misinformation classification.

### 🔗 Fusion Models
Multimodal models combining behavioral and content features.

### 📊 Dashboards
Streamlit and Power BI dashboards for policy and product insights.

### 📘 Research Book
Public research narrative built with Quarto and deployed as a website.

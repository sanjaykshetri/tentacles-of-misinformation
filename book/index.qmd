# The Tentacles of Misinformation

## A Research Monograph on Cognitive Vulnerability and Predictive Analytics

::: {.callout-note}
This research monograph presents an end-to-end study of misinformation susceptibility, integrating behavioral science, NLP, and machine learning to understand who falls for misinformation, why, and how susceptibility can be predicted and mitigated.
:::

### Overview

Misinformation represents one of the most pressing challenges to informed discourse and democratic participation in the digital age. This work extends an IRB-approved Master's thesis on cognitive vulnerability to misinformation with large-scale NLP models, fusion architectures, and interactive decision support systems.

### Key Contributions

- **Behavioral Analysis**: Survey-based identification of cognitive and mindset features that predict susceptibility
- **NLP Classification**: State-of-the-art transformer models for detecting misinformation narratives at scale
- **Fusion Models**: Multimodal architectures combining behavioral and content features for improved predictions
- **Policy Insights**: Actionable dashboards and visualizations for researchers and policymakers
